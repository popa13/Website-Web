				<h2>About me</h2>

				<p>
					My name is Pierre-Olivier Parisé. I am a temporary assistant professor at the <a href="https://math.hawaii.edu/wordpress/" class = "aLink" title = "Dep. Math. UH" target="blank_">Department of Mathematics of the University of Hawaii at Manoa</a>. My research is supported by a postdoctoral research schorlarship (B3X) and an NSERC postdoctoral scholarship.

					<!--I also received a 2-years long postdoctoral research scholarship (B3X) from the FRQNT to work alongside <a href = "http://math.hawaii.edu/~myounsi/" class="aLink" title="Malik Younsi" target = "blank_">Malik Younsi</a>, a professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.-->

				<p>
					I received my Ph. D. from Laval University (QC, Ca). My supervisor was <a href="https://www.mat.ulaval.ca/departement-et-professeurs/direction-personnel-et-etudiants/professeurs/fiche-de-professeur/show/ransford-thomas" class="aLink" title="Thomas J. Ransford" target="blank_">Thomas J. Ransford</a>. My research was funded by the Alexander-Graham Bell Graduate scholarship from NSERC and the graduate scholarship from the FRQNT. My thesis main problem was on applications of summability methods to the convergence of the Taylor series in various spaces of holomorphic functions.
				</p>

				<p>
					I obtained a Masters' degree in 2017 from Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières. My supervisor was <a href = "http://www.3dfractals.com/" title="Dominic Rochon" class="aLink" target="blank_">Dominic Rochon</a>. The focus of my research was multicomplex dynamical systems and the Mandelbrot sets in the setting of the multicomplex numbers.

				<p>
					My main research interests are in the field of complex analysis,
 					including topics in geometric function theory, operator theory and spaces of holomorphic functions. I am also interested in holomorphic dynamics and its generalizations to higher dimensions using the multicomplex numbers.

					<p>
						I have ten years of experience and training in teaching since the beginning of my career. I am convinced that an engaged student will learn and retain the material of a class more efficiently. During the Covid-19 crisis, this belief became even more important in my teaching style, and I realized that it was my responsibility to create an environment in which students want to be involved.

				<p>
					Mathematics is a huge branch of Science. I'm interested in almost everything in mathematics. You will find some articles on many subjects: pure maths curiosity, applied mathematics and "deep" connection between maths and physics. My purpose is to give an introduction to a topic that is accessible to most commun mortals. Occasionaly, I will also write on advanced subjects. If this is the case, an alert note will be given at the beginning of the article.

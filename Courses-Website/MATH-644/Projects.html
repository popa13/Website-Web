                    <h3> Spectrum of an Element in a \(\mathbf{C^\ast}\)-Algebra</h3>

                    <p>
                        A \(C^\ast\)-Algebra, say \(A\), is a complex normed vector space where you can multiply each element and have a special operation \(\ast\), called a <emph>conjugation</emph>. The conjugation \(\ast\) mimics the properties of the complex conjugate:
                            <ul>
                                <li> \( (a + b)^\ast = a^\ast + b^\ast\).</li>
                                <li> \( (ab)^\ast = b^\ast a^\ast \).</li>
                                <li> \( (\lambda a )^\ast = \overline{\lambda} a^\ast \), \(\lambda \) is a complex number.</li>
                                <li> \((a^\ast)^\ast = a\).</li>
                                <li> \(\Vert a a^\ast \Vert = \Vert a \Vert^2\).</li>
                            </ul>
                        The typical example of a \(C^\ast\)-Algebra is the set of complex numbers with the complex conjugate. Another important example of a \(C^\ast\)-Algebra is the set of \(n \times n\) matrices \(A\) with complex entries. The ''conjugation'' operation in this case is the adjoint \(A^\ast\) of a matrix \(A\).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It is well-known how to define the spectrum \(\sigma (A)\) of a matrix \(A\): It is the set of complex numbers \(\lambda\) such that \(\mathrm{det} (A - \lambda I) = 0\). Due to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, we know that the spectrum \(\sigma (A)\) of a \(n \times n\) matrix \(A\) is non-empty: It is in fact the roots of the polynomial equation \(\mathrm{det} (A - \lambda I) = 0\).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The space of \(n \times n\) matrices with complex entries is a special case of a \(C^\ast\)-Algebra. However, in the general framework of \(C^\ast\)-Algebras, it is not true anymore that the spectrum is the set of solutions to \(\mathrm{det} (A - \lambda I ) = 0\). Therefore, the aim of this project is to generalize the concept of the ''spectrum'' to an element in a \(C^\ast\)-Algebra. Then, the second goal is to prove that if \(a\) is an element of a \(C^\ast\)-Algebra, then its spectrum \(\sigma (a)\) is non-empty. This proof involves, as we would suspect due to the use of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra in the matrix case, complex analysis methods.

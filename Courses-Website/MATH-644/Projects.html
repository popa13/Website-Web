            <p>
                Below you will find a potential list of projects and the instructions for the paper to write. The paper is due by May, 9th.

                    <h3> Spectrum of an Element in a \(\mathbf{C^\ast}\)-Algebra (Lynette and Aleksander) </h3>

                    <p>
                        The aim of this project is to generalize the concept of the ''spectrum'' to an element in a \(C^\ast\)-Algebra. Then, the second goal is to prove that if \(a\) is an element of a \(C^\ast\)-Algebra, then its spectrum \(\sigma (a)\) is non-empty. This proof involves, as we would suspect due to the use of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra in the matrix case, complex analysis methods.

                    <h3> The Hardy Space \( H^2 \) of The Unit Disk (Dennis)</h3>

                    <p>
                        For an analytic function \(f\) on the unit disk, define
                            $$
                            \sup_{0 < r < 1} \int_0^{2\pi} |f(r e^{i\theta})|^2 \, d\theta < \infty .
                            $$
                        Analytic functions in the unit disk satisfying the above constraint are said to be in the Hardy space \(H^2\). In this project, you will present this space and show some of its important properties, such as the existence of radial limits almost everywhere. [Comment: Some knowledge in Measure Theory is required to fully appreciate this project.]
